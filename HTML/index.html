            <h4>FOCUS ON EXCELLENCE</h4>
            <p>"Everyone here is really good at what they do. For me personally, I only want to work at places that are going to push me and my craft, and not just in animation, but also the craft of making a really good game."</p>
            <h6>MIKE YOSH, ANIMATION DIRECTOR</h6>
                        
            <h4>DIGITAL-FIRST STUDIO</h4>
            <p>"So much of our work is thinking through tough problems. Our digital first approach gives us the freedom to create our ideal environment to focus and become more effective at problem-solving."</p>
            <h6>JON PAQUETTE, SENIOR NARRATIVE DIRECTOR</h6>

            <h4>COLLABORATION</h4>
            <p>"The reality is a game is made up of a thousand tiny moments and a thousand little ideas and we want everyone to be able to contribute."</p>
            <h6>AL HASTINGS, HEAD OF ARCHITECTURE</h6>

            <h4>ANYONE CAN MAKE AN IMPACT</h4>
            <p>"At Insomniac there’s just a general culture that everyone’s opinion is valued…you can speak up and your opinion matters."</p>
            <h6>BEN VAN DYKEN, ADVANCED SENIOR ANIMATOR</h6>

            <h4>CREATIVE OWNERSHIP</h4>
            <p>"In Sunset Overdrive, our lead animator was working on character death respawns and he thought what if we did them in a cool Insomniac way that really ﬁt the tone of the game? We ended up making a lot of them and it kinda made you want to die in the game just to see the next respawn. I think THAT kind of thing is what makes Insomniac, Insomniac."</p>
            <h6>BRIAN HASTINGS, HEAD OF CREATIVE STRATEGY</h6>

            <h4>OPEN-DOOR POLICY</h4>
            <p>"Ted and I both have said people can come talk to us anytime about anything. Maybe that doesn’t exist at other studios, maybe part of that is because when you’re that big you can’t just walk into a leader’s ofﬁce. But that’s what’s cool about being here. People at every level at Insomniac are invested in the projects we’re making."</p>
            <h6>JOHN FIORITO, HEAD OF OPERATIONS</h6>
